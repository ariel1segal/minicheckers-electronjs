<h1>Simplefied Checkers Game</h1>
<h2>Setting of the Game</h2>
This game is played on a 5x5 checkers board, that all it's corners are black. 
The Board contains 25 squares. There are two players, one playing with the white pieces, and 
the other is playing with the black pieces. Each player has 12 pieces. At the beginning of 
the game, the pieces are arranged such, that white pieces are on the white squares, and 
black pieces are on the black squares. There are total of 24 pieces on the board, so only 
one square is free.
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>
To block your opponent's pieces, i.e. your opponent's pieces have no where to go.
<h2>How to Play</h2>
Players take turns. At each turn the player moves one of his or hers pieces to the empty 
square.<br>
To make the user interface look nicer, the "black" squares are blue, and the "white" pieces 
are red. To move with a piece just click on it. You play against my program, choose your 
color (default for human player is RED).
